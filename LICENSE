Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                         Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most
software and other practical works are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make
sure it remains free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients
that you received. You must make sure that everyone else also has these
freedoms. And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) use the copyright to enforce the license. We need to make
exceptions to this rule for software that is copyrighted by others.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
face patent litigation. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyone to use or distribute the
software.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

    "This License" refers to version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

    "Copyright holder" is the individual, organization, or
    other entity holding the copyright of the Program.

    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
    this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you."

    "You" means the licensee, or, in the case of a derived
    work, the author of the derived work.

    "Source code" refers to the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it. "Object code" refers to any non-source
    form of the work.

    "Work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
    derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
    containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
    with modifications, that is based on the Program.

    "Distribution" means making the Program available to anyone by
    any means.

    "Conveying" means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies of the Program. The term
    "propagate" and related terms have a corresponding meaning.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
  intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
  absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
  Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
  conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified Program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
    an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
    a notice that there is no warranty (or other indication of a
    warranty), and that users may redistribute the program under
    these terms.

  3. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
  to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is void, and
  will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

  4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
  or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
  are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
  by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on
  the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
  so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing,
  and modifying the Program or works based on it.

  5. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
  the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
  the original licensor to copy, distribute, or modify the Program
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
  further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
  granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
  by third parties to this License.

  6. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent claims),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
  or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
  do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
  you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program
  by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would
  be to refrain entirely from distributing the Program.

  7. If the Program is distributed in object code form, you must
  provide the corresponding source code under the terms of this License,
  in one of the following ways:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of this
    License, and which must be included in the same place as the
    object code and distributed with it, or

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than the
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of this License, or

    c) Accompany it with a copy of the written offer, valid for at least
    three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than the
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-
    readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed
    under the terms of this License, with the source code included in
    the object code distribution.

  8. You must ensure that everyone who receives a copy of the Program
  or a work based on it, under this License, has the same rights you
  received. You must include the same License in all copies or substantial
  portions of the Program.

  9. If you modify the Program and distribute it, you must include the
  following notice along with the modified Program: "This program is
  distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
  WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License
  for more details."

  10. If the Program is interactive and you include a program to
  interact with it, you must include a prominent notice stating that
  the software is interactive and offering a warranty for the Program.

  11. The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating
  your program into proprietary programs. If you intend to include
  the Program in proprietary software, you should consider a different
  license.

  12. The GNU General Public License does not grant you permission
  to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or other
  identifiers of the Free Software Foundation, except as required by
  the License.

  13. If you have questions about this License, or if you wish to
  make changes to the License, contact the Free Software Foundation,
  Inc.

  14. Any changes to this License, or any additional terms or
  conditions, must be accompanied by a copy of this License.

  15. The license terminates automatically if you fail to comply with
  any of its terms.

  16. No warranty is provided. The Program is provided "as is," and
  without warranty of any kind. The authors and copyright holders
  disclaim all warranties, including the implied warranties of
  merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

  17. You may obtain a copy of the GNU General Public License from:

  If you want to use the software for proprietary or non-GPL-compliant
  purposes, you can offer to distribute it under the GNU General Public
  License version 3.0 (GPLv3) instead.
